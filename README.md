# paxos

master.py updated

grading.py added

One test case added:
tests directory includes the input texts and output requirements,
test_output directory includes sample outputs.
Your outputs do not need to be the same as the outputs in the test_output
directory, as long as it satisfies the output requirements specified by the
tests directory.

For the meaning of the output requirements, you can guess or read the
grading.py script. Basically, for each line in the output requirement, it (1)
reads "count" lines from your output, (2) checks if they are identical, (3)
checks if it includes everything in 'mandatory', and (4) checks if it doesn't
include anything not in 'mandatory' or 'optional'.


More test cases are on the way...
Same as the 3PC project, I will give out 8 public test cases.
